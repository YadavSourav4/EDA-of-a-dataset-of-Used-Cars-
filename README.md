Stepwise EDA of dataset of used cars to predict the cars price
**Used Cars Dataset Analysis**
This repository contains an analysis of a dataset focused on used cars. The dataset includes information such as the car's name, location, year, kilometers driven, fuel type, transmission, owner type, price, and other relevant attributes.

**Overview**
The analysis of this dataset involves several steps and tasks:

**Data Preprocessing:** Handling missing values, creating new features like 'Car_Age', splitting the 'Name' column into 'Brand' and 'Model', exploring numerical and categorical columns, checking skewness, and performing log transformations.

**Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Statistical summaries, visualization of distributions, correlation analyses, and deriving insights based on different attributes of used cars.

**Machine Learning Models:** Building predictive models to estimate the price of used cars based on their attributes.

**Contents**
data/: Folder containing the dataset used for analysis.

notebooks/: Jupyter notebooks containing the code for data preprocessing, EDA, and machine learning models.

README.md: This file, providing an overview of the project and instructions to replicate the analysis.

**Requirements**

Python 3

Jupyter Notebook

Libraries: pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, scikit-learn, etc. (requirements listed in a requirements.txt file)


**Usage**
